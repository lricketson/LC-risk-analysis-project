### What I was trying to do:

Finding how to output confidence interval using a fast and streamlined python library like scipy etc

### What blocked me:

it looked like a lot of effort for just a confidence interval and there must be a better way

### Where to start next time:

look up how to output a confidence interval using python, as in what's the best way using a built in python library
