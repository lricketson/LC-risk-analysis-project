i am about to make a did_default flag in the df. the full set of loan statuses is this:
{'Current', 'Fully Paid', 'Charged Off', 'Late (31-120 days)', 'In Grace Period', 'Late (16-30 days)'}

all rows that are current are being dropped so we don't care about that
i should count how many are current so i know how much data im throwing out
fully paid means not default
charged off means defaulted
late (31-120 days), in grace period, and late (16-30 days) are grey areas. i can choose what to do about these.
my decision on whether to treat them as default or not (since e.g. being late by 90+ days conventionally means
default i think) may depend on how much of the data has those statuses.
