    "## Robustness Test: Testing Whether FICO Score is Independent of Default Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous test, it was found that loan Grade is probabilistically certain to have a dependent relationship with default rate. In this test, we test the robustness of that by exchanging the variable Grade for FICO score, a similar metric. Everything is basically the same except with FICO score band instead of Grade.\n",
