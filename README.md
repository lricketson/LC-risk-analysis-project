This app investigates the probability of default once a LendingClub loan has been approved, and what factors influence it.

## Overview

Not all approved loans are made equal; that is, approved loans can have very different risks associated with them. Banks and other lending agencies, like LendingClub, need to know what the risk of default is for a loan, given attributes of the borrower and loan. This risk is used to calculate interest rates, held expected loss, secondary market valuations for on-selling, and portfolio diversification.

## Techniques

- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Statistical analysis
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Data and Methodology

Uses the 2.6 million row LendingClub approved loans dataset.
Conducts various analyses in notebook pages, including two-sample t-tests for the mean, chi-square tests of independence, robustness tests, and confidence intervals.
